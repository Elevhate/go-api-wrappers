# How to Contribute

We want to make contributing to this project as easy as possible.

## Reporting Issues

If you have an issue, please report it on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/elevhate/go-api-wrappers/issues).

When you are up for writing a PR to solve the issue you encountered, it's not
needed to first open a separate issue. In that case only opening a PR with a
description of the issue you are trying to solve is just fine.

## Contributing Code

Pull requests are always welcome. When in doubt if your contribution fits within
the rest of the project, feel free to first open an issue to discuss your idea.

This is not needed when fixing a bug or adding an enhancement, as long as the
enhancement you are trying to add can be found in the public GitLab API docs as
this project only supports what is in the public API docs.
